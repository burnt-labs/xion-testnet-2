## Overview

The Xion v23 series introduces several key improvements focusing on chain upgrade preparation, enhanced fee abstraction backward compatibility, WASM module updates, and workflow automation. The recommended version is v23.0.0.

## What's Changed

### v23.0.0

#### Chain Upgrade to v23

- **Version Bump**: Bumped the chain upgrade version from v22 to v23 across codebase, including UpgradeName constant, test cases, and documentation
- **Upgrade Handler Improvements**: Enhanced the upgrade handler to log the wasm module version before and after migrations, improving upgrade observability and debugging

#### WASM Module Updates

- **WasmD v0.61.6-xion.3**: Updated to wasmd v0.61.6-xion.3 which reverts ContractInfo to previous proto format in [#428](https://github.com/burnt-labs/xion/pull/428)

#### Fee Abstraction Backward Compatibility

- **Legacy Type URL Registrations**: Added legacy type URL registrations in `x/feeabs/types/codec.go` to maintain backward compatibility with governance proposals created before the proto package rename in [#429](https://github.com/burnt-labs/xion/pull/429)
- **Proto Path Fixes**: Fixed feeabs proto paths to ensure old proposals can still be decoded and processed

#### API and Documentation
